Overview of what this program does:
The goal of this program is to give you a more personal and targeted dictionary list rather than just using a large list of random words.
This program will ask you a series of questions about your target and generate a list of possible passwords using the answers you provide.
The text file can then be added to an exsiting dictionary list or used by itself to try to crack passwords.

Currently the program only generates a small wordlist. I do plan to expand it.

This is still very much a work in progress and I plan to add more functionailty in the future.
